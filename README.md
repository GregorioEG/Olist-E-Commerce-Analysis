# E-commerce Data Analysis
Hello! My name is Gregorio Gonzalez, and I'm a industrial engineer. 
I made this project to showcase some of my skills of SQL and Python for data analysis. The goal is to perform all data manipulation using only SQL, and use python only to visualize the results.

The dataset I'll be analyzing originates from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that links small businesses with larger product marketplaces. 
This dataset, published by Olist, includes 99,441 orders spanning from March 2016 to August 2018. 
The data is anonymized, meaning it doesn't include names of buyers, sellers, or products.

In the 'Queries' folder you can find all the SQL queries used in the analysis.
In the notebook file called "Olist2.ipynb" we'll explore some of their fields. 
These are the Contents we'll cover.

  1. [Number of orders] (https://github.com/GregorioEG/Olist-E-Commerce-Analysis/blob/main/Notebooks/1.%20Number_of_orders.ipynb)
