# Portfolio
Hi! My name is Gregorio Gonzalez, and I'm a industrial engineer. I wrote this portfolio to showcase some of the capabilities of SQL for data analysis. The goal is to perform all data manipulation using only SQL, and use python only to visualize the results.

The dataset I'll be analyzing originates from Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce platform that links small businesses with larger product marketplaces. This dataset, published by Olist, includes 99,441 orders spanning from March 2016 to August 2018. The data is anonymized, meaning it doesn't include names of buyers, sellers, or products. I imported the original CSV files into an SQLite.
